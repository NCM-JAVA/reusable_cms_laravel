                        CIVIL APPEAL No.10126 OF 2010

CONSUMER PROTECTION COUNCIL, ROURKELA              .......APPELLANT

                                   VERSUS

INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD.AND ORS.               ......RESPONDENTS



                              O   R   D   E   R

            Delay condoned.
            This appeal is directed against order  dated  16.08.2007  passed
by the National Consumer Disputes  Redressal  Commission  (for  short,  `the
National Commission'), the  operative  portion  of  which  reads  as  under:

           "1.   The Ministry of Petroleum is  given  four  years  time  as
           prayed for, in terms of the  submissions  and  our  observations
           mentioned hereinabove.


           2.    The Ministry of Petroleum  as  well  as  the  Ministry  of
           Consumer Affairs shall ensure that all  Marketing  Companies  do
           issue necessary instructions that the Distributors will  provide
           to deliveryman proper weighing scale for the purpose of weighing
           LPG Gas Cylinder in the presence of customers and they will give
           it due publicity  by  publishing  the  same  in  the  vernacular
           language of each and every State as well as in English and Hindi
           newspapers apart from giving similar type of advertisement in TV
           for information of the consumers."



      During the pendency of the special leave petition out  of  which  this
appeal arises, several orders were passed for  ensuring  compliance  of  the
directions  given  by  the  National  Commission.  In  compliance   of   the
direction given by the Court, detailed counter   affidavits  were  filed  on
behalf of respondent Nos.6, 7 and 8  apart  from  the  impleaded  respondent
i.e. the Union of India through the Ministry of Petroleum.
            In para 16 of  the  affidavit  filed  by  Smt.  Sushma  Rath  in
August, 2012, the deponent has furnished the particulars of the steps  taken
by various oil companies to modernise LPG bottling plants  and  instructions
issued   by   them    to    the    distributors    to    provide    portable
electronic/mechanical weighing scales to the deliveryman so that  weight  of
the cylinders could be checked at the time of  delivery.   The  Ministry  of
Petroleum and the oil  companies  have  also  issued  advertisement  in  the
newspapers and the electronic media for making  the  consumers  aware  about
their rights to get the prescribed quantity of  gas.  Directions  have  also
been  issued  to  the  dealers  for  ensuring  that  the  deliveryman  carry
weighing machines at the time of delivery of cylinders.
            In view of the steps taken by the Government of  India  and  the
oil companies, no further direction is required to be issued in  the  matter
and the appeal is disposed of as infructuous.
            However, it is made clear that if  any  individual  consumer  or
group of consumers have any grievance against  any  company  or  the  dealer
then he/they shall be free to avail appropriate remedy including the one  by
filing complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
